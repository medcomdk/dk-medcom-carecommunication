This page presents MedCom's CareCommunication standard (Danish: Korrespondancemeddelelse). This standard will in time replace the existing standards <a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Den%20gode%20korrespondance/EDI/Dokumentation/" target="_blank">DIS91</a> and <a href="https://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Den%20gode%20korrespondance/XML/Dokumentation/" target="_blank">XDIS91</a>. The purpose of the standard is to support digital communication between healthcare professionals by enabling message-based data exchange. The standard can be used to communicate about a patient or a citizen between healthcare parties, such as municipalities, general parctitioners, hospitals, physiotherapists and many more.

### 1.1 Clinical guidelines for application 
The clinical guidelines for application are the foundation for the CareCommunication standard. It describes the clinical needs for the modernization, the requirements for the content of the standard and how the standard supports the business requirements. It is the primary textual part of the documentation for CareCommunication. It is important for both implementers and business specialists to understand the clinical guidelines for application to ensure that the implemented standard supports the requirements.

Below, the clinical guidelines for application in both Danish and English can be found:<br>
